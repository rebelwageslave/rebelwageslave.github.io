<p>Hello, my name is Ben, today I will talk about my mom and out little hero Charlie. My mom Emma Smith was 42 when her dog kept sniffing her right breast. But it turned out that Charlie the dog was on to something.</p>



<p>When I was seven my mom took me and my brother Jack, six, to pick a puppy from a litter of Staffordshire Bull Terriers, it was love at first sight.</p>



<p>Right away, little Charlie came bounding over to meet us, and from that moment on she was part of the family.</p>



<p>She was a little bundle of energy and quite naughty, chewing everything she could get her paws on but she was so sweet and loving that no one could stay cross for long.</p>



<p>But when Charlie was just a few months old she began acting oddly, jumping up and sniffing at the right side of mom’s chest.</p>

<p>The brain is complex, but extremely fascinating. We need more people interested in studying the brain because 1 in 5 people are likely to develop a neurological disorder&#8230; and there are no cures! Greg is a neuroscientist and electrical engineer who loves tinkering with all things electric. He’s developing tools, curriculum, and experiments that allow the general public to participate, hands-on, in neuroscience discovery. He is a senior fellow at TED and an investigator at the National Institute of Health. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community</p>
